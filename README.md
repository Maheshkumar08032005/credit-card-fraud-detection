📦 Credit Card Fraud Detection | Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes 15,000+ credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activity using machine learning and exploratory data analysis. The dataset includes transaction amounts, customer details, time patterns, and fraud labels, enabling a detailed study of behavioral trends.
The goal of this project is to identify fraud indicators, evaluate model accuracy, and support secure, data-driven financial decision-making.

📊 Project Objectives

Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transaction Distribution

Transaction Amount Comparison (Fraud vs Normal)

Time-Based Fraud Trend Analysis

Anomaly Detection Using Statistical Methods

Correlation Heatmap for Key Features

Key findings show that:

Fraud transactions often occur at odd hours and show higher variability.

A small percentage of transactions cause big financial losses.

Certain features significantly influence fraud detection, improving model accuracy.

📌 Purpose

The objective of this project is to help financial institutions and analysts detect fraud early, reduce monetary loss, and create secure transaction systems. This analysis demonstrates how machine learning and pattern recognition can identify suspicious behavior and support real-time fraud prevention.
